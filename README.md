# homework

Each directory in this repository is a programming assignment. While you can complete them in any order, we recommend doing the parser project before the auditor project.

# notes

* These are simple projects but yet feel free to use as many non-human resources you would like.
* There is no reward for speed, thought process is what we are looking for. Remember your thought process :-)
* While jumping on a problem right away is good trait, but thinking through the problem is another characterstic we look for.
* We believe solutions become better over time before they become best. We expect to see that in the code.
* Quality of code is even more important than a perfect solution. Good quality code has a chance to become better over time, poor quality gets worse over time.
