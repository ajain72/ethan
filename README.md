# homework

Each directory in this repository is a programming assignment. While you can complete them in any order, we recommend doing the parser project before the auditor project.

# notes

* These are simple projects but yet feel free to use as many non-human resources you would like.
* There is no reward for speed, thought process is what we are looking for. Remember your thought process :-)
* We believe best solutions become best over time. We expect to see that in the code.
