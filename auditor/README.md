#PROGRAM - AUDITOR

Write an application using javascript that takes two json files - file1 and file2 as input and provides a side by side comparison of the data contained in those two files in the browser. There should be some visual clues such as red color when data doesn't match but we leave that to your creativity.
We have provided two sample files but of course the solution should work with any two files in the given format, for example what if I input file1.txt and file1.txt for comparison, or file1.txt and nodata.txt.

Feel free to commit your test data files to impress us.
#SAMPLE DATA OBJECT

Each object in the json files is expected to be in the following structure.

{"name":{"firstName": "John", "lastName" : "Doe"}, "dob":"01/01/1933", "ssn":"123-12-1233"}


#LOST?
Make as many assumptions as you would like, just make a note of those either in the code or readme file.
